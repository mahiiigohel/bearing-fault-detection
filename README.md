# Bearing Fault Detection in High-Speed Textile Spinning Frames

##  Problem Statement
Undetected bearing faults can cause spindle seizure and machine breakdown...

## Objective
To build an AI-based early warning system for fault detection in spinning frame bearings.

##  Dataset
- Case Western Reserve University Bearing Dataset (CWRU)
- Used 10 classes: Normal + 9 fault types
- Source: https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter

## Model
- Logistic Regression
- Accuracy Achieved: ~95%
- Evaluation: Confusion Matrix (see below)

##  Tools & Platform
- Kaggle Notebook  
- Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Seaborn

##  Output Example
